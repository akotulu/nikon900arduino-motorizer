# Description:  This perl script is for logging of data from a serial
# port, to a specified logfile.  The logfile can then be parsed with
# other programs for reporting purposes.
# 
# This program was written for specifically logging Multitech's
# MTASR2-203 T1 Router.  The router outputs text to the command
# port with 57.6k, 8-1-N, and No flow control.
